?b2DownloadFilebyId
?b2DownloadFileByName
?b2GetFileInfo

?b2UpdateBucket
```

Currently no documentation. Please refer directly to the [Backblaze B2 API documentation](https://www.backblaze.com/b2/docs/) for now.

## Disclaimer

Be careful with your stuff. This is a very early alpha version of this package. Things may go badly wrong.
